        <p>There are plenty of articles mention about Monte Carlo algorithm, however non of them investigate deeper in its techniques. This article is a note from Chapter 31 of Computer Graphics Principle and Practice, which may show some practical techniques of Monte Carlo algorithm.</p>

        <p>Monte Carlo algorithm is mainly used in situation where directly integration is hard or impossible. By sampling following a specific distribution and averaging those samplings, we can get a good estimation of the target integration.<p>
